# Introduction to Support Vector Machines

### Goal
Mathematical understanding of SVMs. Implementation of a simple use case.

### Language
```R```

### Contents
1. Introduction to C-SVM
2. Support Vector Machines and cross-validation

### Libraries
* ```kernlab```
* ```pROC```
* ```caret```
* ```plotly```

### Conclusion
After cross-validation, I find an accuracy of 89% on the Test set, for values of Ïƒ = 0.6 and C = 4.2. That seems to be a
very good score for our study.
